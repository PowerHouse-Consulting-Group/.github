## // System Architecture & Capabilities

We treat digital growth and data hygiene as strict engineering problems. We do not sell "synergy"; we deploy custom APIs, automated workflows, and enterprise-grade security.

### 1. RevOps Architecture & Integrations
* **Bi-directional Syncs:** Flawless data mapping between Salesforce, HubSpot, and custom ERPs.
* **Custom Middleware:** Bridging native API gaps to create a single source of truth.
* **Data Normalization:** Automated pipeline cleaning and routing.

### 2. Infrastructure & Cybersecurity
* **VPS / Dedicated Hardening:** OS-level security configurations and environment provisioning.
* **Bot Mitigation & WAF:** Enterprise firewalls to block malicious scraping and DDoS vectors.
* **Deep-Code Audits:** Diagnostic teardowns of legacy applications to patch vulnerabilities.

### 3. AI & Automation (LLM Workflows)
* **Autonomous Agents:** Building custom data-enrichment and support-triage bots.
* **Operational Leverage:** Replacing manual human CRM data entry with secure API nodes.

### 4. Engineered Acquisition

## // The PowerHouse Standard

* **Radical Transparency:** We provide diagnostic teardowns of broken systems, exposing sloppy code and broken APIs with clinical precision.
* **Zero Fluff:** You work with Senior Architects, not account managers.
* **AI-Optimized:** Our infrastructure is built to be read by humans and machines. (See our [`llms.txt`](https://powerhouseconsulting.group/llms.txt) protocol).
